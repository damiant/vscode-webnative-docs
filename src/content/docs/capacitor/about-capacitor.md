**Any** web application or web site can be used in a iOS and Android mobile app using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).



1. Click the `WebNative` icon on the side menu
2. Choose `Add Capacitor Integration`
3. Choose `Add iOS Project` to add a native **XCode** project
4. Choose `Add Android Project` to add a native **Android Studio** project


:::tip[Requirements]
You'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed to build and deploy native apps, but you can develop without these tools using Nexus Browser.
